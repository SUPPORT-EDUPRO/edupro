## Overview

**EduDashPro Community School** is a digital-first educational platform designed for independent learners and families not affiliated with a traditional preschool or school organization.

### Focus Areas

## Business Model

### Free Tier (Ad-Supported)
Community School users on the free tier receive:
- **Limited daily AI features** to manage costs
- **Ad-supported experience** to generate revenue
- Full access to digital learning content

### Revenue Strategy
```
Free Users → View Ads → Ad Revenue → Cover AI API Costs
```

## Free Tier Quotas

Community parents get the following **daily/monthly limits**:

| Feature | Free Tier Limit | Period |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Exams | 3 | Per Month |
| Explanations | 5 | Per Month |
| Chat Messages | 10 | Per Day |

These limits are designed to:
1. Provide meaningful learning value
2. Keep AI API costs sustainable
3. Encourage upgrades to paid tiers for heavy users

## Ad Integration

### Current Setup
- **Platform**: Google AdMob

- **Rewarded Ads**: Max 2 per day (e.g., unlock extra AI requests)

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
RATE_LIMITS = {
  interstitialMinInterval: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes
  interstitialMaxPerDay: 3,
  rewardedMaxPerDay: 2,
  initialGracePeriod: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute after app start

```

### Quota Enforcement

### Ad Display Logic
```typescript
shouldShowAds = tier === 'free' && Platform.OS === 'android'
```
